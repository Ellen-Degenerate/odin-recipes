    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the cubed chicken with the carrots, 
                peas, and celery for about 15 minutes. 
                Drain and set aside. Cook the onions in 
                butter until they're translucent, then stir 
                in the flour and seasonings. Add the chicken 
                broth and milk and simmer until the filling is thick.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken-vegetable mixture in an unbaked 
                pie crust. Pour the chicken broth mixture over it. 
                Cover with the top crust, seal the edges, and cut 
                slits in the top to allow the steam to escape. 
                Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
